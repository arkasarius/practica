# practica cordova by Roger Ordo√±ez Brumos #

This project uses Cordova Jquerymobile and cordova-plugin-splashscreen
I installed JDk 1.8 and android studio with a Virtual device to test the APK generated.
To make it work it needs Node.js to use npm.
It also needs git to call for "repos" like the cordova plugin.
I used Atom for its friendly user interface and addons like the terminal inside the editor.
I modified the splashscreen in src with photoshop and its located on practica1\practica1\res\screen\android/screen-hdpi-portrait.png
The splash screen its called with the pluggin as a tag identified in the line 20 of the config.xml on the root of practica1 folder.
The apk of the project is inside practica1\practica1\platforms\android\build\outputs\apk
